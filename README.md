# Equalify Accounting
This repo includes all information related to Equalify accounting (income, expenses, and taxes).

## Where is the thinking behind the budgets?
See our [Equalify Handbook](https://github.com/equalifyEverything/handbook) for thoughts behind the numbers.

## Why are so many invoices from Decubing?
Almost all Equalify bills are processed via Decubing Web Services, Blake's old company, to minimize our overhead. Decubing has many systems in place for managing web development.  Currently, Decubing can pay expenses related to servicing the Equalify contract without charging Equalify an extra fee by taking advantage of State and Federal R&D tax credits.  As soon as it becomes more economical, Equalify will handle all bills.

## Accounting for R&D Work
All developers who work with Equalify, except for Blake Bertuccelli-Booth, will be exclusively engaged in approved R&D work. For more information on what's approved see [this document (linked) from Louisiana](https://www.opportunitylouisiana.gov/incentive/research-and-development-tax-credit) and [this document (linked) on Federal R&D expenses](https://support.gusto.com/article/197779649100000/Federal-Research-and-Development-R-D-Tax-Credit). Blake Bertuccelli-Booth's activities, since they both included approved R&D work and non R&D work, will be marked as the work is completed.
