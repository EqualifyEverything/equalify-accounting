This repo includes all information related to Equalify accounting (income, expenses, and taxes).

## Why are so many invoices from Decubing?
Almost all Equalify bills are processed via Decubing Web Services, Blake's old company, to minimize our overhead. Decubing has many systems in place for managing web development. As soon as it becomes more economical, Equalify can just handle all bills.
