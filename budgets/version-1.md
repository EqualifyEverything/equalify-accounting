## June - September 2024 (Version 1) Budget

### Currently in the bank:
$76,489.39

### Goal:
Spend under $33,000 and sell three subscriptions by September ($17,160). This would allow us to do another three-month development push to Version 1.5 then and a third (Version 2) before February 2025, with each three-month push costing $33,000. We are aiming to sell three licenses every three months. In that case, we'll also be able to have enough cash for a fourth push in February. That February push should get us to $200,000 in revenue by August 2025, when we'll hopefully increase development spending to reach our ultimate goal of sustainability by 2028 with 100M Equalified fixes logged and about $2M in revenue.
